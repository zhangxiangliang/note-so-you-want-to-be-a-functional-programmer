# Part One

## Forget Everything You Know
* Learning Functional Programming takes a while. So be patient.

## Purity
* When Functional Programmers talk of Purity, they are referring to Pure Functions.
* Most useful Pure Functions must take at least one parameter.
* All useful Pure Functions must return something.
* Pure Functions will always produce the same output given the same inputs.
* Pure functions have no side effects.
* The goal is to minimize the amount of impure code and segregate it from the rest of out program.

## Immutablility
* There are no variables in Functional Programming.
* Functional Programming uses recursion to do looping.
* Immutability creates simpler and safer code.
