# Part Three

## Function Composition
* In math, `f ∘ g` is functional composition and is read `f composed with g` or, more commonly, `f after g`. So `(f ∘ g)(x)` is equivalent to calling `f` after calling `g` with `x` or simply, `f(g(x))`.

## Point-Free Notation
* There is a style of writing functions without having to specify the parameters called `Point-Free Notation`.
* We don't have to specify redundant parameters. And since we don't have to specify them, we don't have to think up names for all of them.
* It's easier to read and reason about since it's less verbose.
* Ponit-Free Notation for brevity, clarity and flexibility.

## Trouble in Paradise
* So it would appear that Function Composition has limited usefulness since we cannot marry these two functions. That’s too bad since it’s so powerful.
* Turns out there is way and it's called `Currying`.
