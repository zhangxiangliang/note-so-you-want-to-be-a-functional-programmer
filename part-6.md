# Part Six
## Functional Javascript
* Use `Immutability`.
* Use `Currying` and `Composition`.
* Use `Ramda`.
* Use Map, Filter and Reduce.

## Javascript Shortcomings
### Why learn Elm?
> Programming in a Pure Functional Language is both limiting and freeing. It limits what you can do (mostly by keeping you from shooting yourself in the foot) but at the same time it frees you from bugs and bad design decisions since all Elm programs follow The Elm Architecture, a Functionally Reactive Model.
> Functional Programming will make you a better programmer. The ideas in this article are only the tip of the iceberg. You really need to see them in practice to really appreciate how your programs will shrink in size and grow in stability.
> Javascript was initially built in 10 days and then patched for the last two decades to become a somewhat functional, somewhat object-oriented and a fully imperative programming language. Elm was designed using what has been learned in the last 30 years of work in the Haskell community, which draws from decades of work in mathematics and computer science. The Elm Architecture (TEA) was designed and refined over the years and is a result of Evan’s thesis in Functional Reactive Programming. Watch Controlling Time and Space to appreciate the level of thinking that went into the formulation of this design.
> Elm is designed for front-end web developers. It’s aimed at making their lives easier. Watch Let’s Be Mainstream to better understand this goal.

## The Future
* There will be a clear move toward languages that compile to Javascript.
* Functional Programming ideas that have been around for over 40 years will be rediscovered to solve our current software complexity problems.
* The state of hardware, e.g. gigabytes of cheap memory and fast processors, will make functional techniiques viable.
* CPUs will not get faster but the number of cores will continue to increase.
* Mutable state will be recognized as one of the biggest problems in complex systems.
